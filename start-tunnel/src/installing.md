# Installing

Install StartTunnel on a Debian VPS by renting a server, running the one-line installer script, and initializing the web interface. The entire process takes just a few minutes.

## Get a VPS

Rent a cheap Debian 12+ VPS with a dedicated public IP. Minimum CPU/RAM/disk is fine. For bandwidth, no need to exceed your home Internet's upload speed.

### Requirements

- Debian 13
- Root access
- Public IP (required for clearnet port forwarding; not required for private VPN use)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> StartTunnel is designed to be the sole application on your VPS. The installer disables UFW and manages its own firewall rules via iptables. Do not run other Internet-facing services on the same VPS.

## Run the installer

SSH into your VPS and run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://start9labs.github.io/start-tunnel/install.sh | sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> If DNS resolution is not working on your VPS, the installer will configure public DNS resolvers (Google, Cloudflare, Quad9) and back up your existing `/etc/resolv.conf`.

## Initialize the web interface

StartTunnel can be fully managed from the command line, but it also offers a web UI for convenience. To set it up, run:

```bash
start-tunnel web init
```

This initializes a web server, creates a random password, generates a Root Certificate Authority (Root CA), and prints them all the console on completion.

Save the URL and password to your password manager, then follow instructions to trust the Root CA.

> [!NOTE]
> The URL, password, and Root CA are only for accessing your StartTunnel's web user interface. None are needed to use StartTunnel from the command line.

## Trust your Root CA

You can access your StartTunnel web UI _without_ trusting its Root CA by powering through the browser warning, but this is less secure and not recommended.

To trust your Root CA, select your operating system and follow instructions:

{{#tabs global="platform" }}
{{#tab name="Mac" }}

1. Open the Terminal app.

1. Type or paste the following command (**do not** press Return yet):

   ```
   pbpaste > ~/Desktop/tunnel-ca.crt
   ```

   Again, **do not** press Return yet.

1. Copy your Root CA to clipboard from the console output (including `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`). **do not** paste it anywhere.

1. Back in Terminal, just press Return. The file `tunnel-ca.crt` is saved to your Desktop.

1. [Trust the certificate](/start-os/trust-ca.html?platform=Mac).

{{#endtab }}
{{#tab name="Windows" }}

1. Open the Notepad app.

1. Copy and paste your Root CA from the console output.

1. Save the file as `tunnel-ca.crt` (plaintext).

1. [Trust the certificate](/start-os/trust-ca.html?platform=Windows).

{{#endtab }}
{{#tab name="Linux" }}

1. Open a text editor (gedit, nano, etc.).

1. Copy and paste your Root CA from the console output.

1. Save the file as `tunnel-ca.crt` (plaintext).

1. [Trust the certificate](/start-os/trust-ca.html?platform=Debian+%2F+Ubuntu).

{{#endtab }}
{{#tab name="Android / Graphene" }}

1. Save the Root CA to a `tunnel-ca.crt` file on your computer (see Mac, Windows, or Linux tabs).

1. Send the `tunnel-ca.crt` file to your phone (email, messaging app, etc.).

1. [Trust the certificate](/start-os/trust-ca.html?platform=Android+%2F+Graphene).

{{#endtab }}
{{#tab name="iOS" }}

1. Save the Root CA to a `tunnel-ca.crt` file on your computer (see Mac, Windows, or Linux tabs).

1. Send the `tunnel-ca.crt` file to your phone (email, messaging app, etc.).
