# StartTunnel

A self-hosted WireGuard VPN optimized for creating VLANs and reverse tunneling to personal servers.

Think of it as a "virtual router in the cloud." Use it for private remote access to self-hosted services, or to expose services to the public Internet without revealing your server's IP address.

- **Clearnet hosting** like Cloudflare Tunnels, but you control the server
- **Private access** like Tailscale, but fully self-hosted
- **Dead simple** — one command to install, manage everything from the CLI or web UI
- **Open source** — audit it, fork it, own it

> [!NOTE]
> For setup instructions, see [Installing](installing.md).

## Features

- **Create Subnets** — Each subnet creates a private VLAN, similar to the LAN created by a home router
- **Add Devices** — Servers, phones, laptops get a LAN IP and unique WireGuard config
- **Forward Ports** — Expose specific ports on specific devices to the public Internet

## How StartTunnel Compares

StartTunnel occupies a unique position between Cloudflare Tunnel and Tailscale. All three solve the problem of connecting devices across the Internet, but they make fundamentally different trade-offs around trust, control, and convenience.

### Architecture

**StartTunnel** is a WireGuard VPN server that runs on a VPS you control. Clients connect via standard WireGuard tunnels. Port forwarding uses kernel-level iptables NAT (Layer 3/4) to route public traffic to devices on the VPN. There is no central service, no coordination server, and no third party in the data path.

**Cloudflare Tunnel** runs a daemon (`cloudflared`) on your machine that makes outbound connections to Cloudflare's global edge network. Public traffic hits Cloudflare's CDN first, where Cloudflare terminates TLS, inspects the request at Layer 7, and proxies it to your origin through the tunnel.

**Tailscale** is a mesh VPN built on WireGuard. A proprietary coordination server (hosted by Tailscale Inc.) distributes keys and facilitates peer discovery, while actual traffic flows directly between devices. For public exposure, Tailscale Funnel routes traffic through Tailscale's ingress servers, which terminate TLS.

### Privacy and Trust

This is the most important difference. It comes down to: **who can see your traffic?**

**StartTunnel**: Nobody but you. Port forwarding operates at Layer 3/4 (iptables DNAT), meaning the VPS rewrites IP headers and forwards packets without inspecting payloads. If a service uses HTTPS, TLS terminates at the service itself — the VPS never sees plaintext. For VPN traffic between devices, WireGuard provides end-to-end encryption. Since you own the VPS, there is no third party with access to your traffic or metadata.

**Cloudflare Tunnel**: Cloudflare terminates TLS at their edge and re-encrypts to your origin. This means Cloudflare can — and does — see plaintext traffic. They offer "TLS inspection" as a feature and can scan request bodies, filter content, and inject responses. Using Cloudflare Tunnel requires trusting a publicly traded company not to misuse its position as a man-in-the-middle on all your traffic.

**Tailscale**: For device-to-device traffic, encryption is end-to-end — even Tailscale's DERP relay servers forward encrypted packets they cannot read. However, the coordination server (run by Tailscale Inc.) sees metadata: which devices are connecting, their IPs, OS versions, and connection state. Tailscale explicitly states it is "not an anonymity service." For public exposure via Funnel, Tailscale's ingress servers terminate TLS, similar to Cloudflare.

### Self-Hosting and Sovereignty

**StartTunnel**: Fully self-hosted. You rent a VPS, run the installer, and own the entire stack. No phone-home, no telemetry, no accounts, no dependency on any company's infrastructure. If Start9 disappeared tomorrow, your tunnel would keep working.

**Cloudflare Tunnel**: The `cloudflared` client runs on your machine, but all traffic must route through Cloudflare's proprietary global network. You cannot self-host the edge. If Cloudflare goes down — as happened in a [5.5-hour outage in November 2025](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/) — your services go down with it.

**Tailscale**: The client is mostly open source, but the coordination server is proprietary. [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) is a community-built open source alternative, but it reimplements a narrower scope (single tailnet) and is not maintained by Tailscale. By default, you depend on Tailscale Inc. for key distribution, peer discovery, and DERP relays.

### Vendor Lock-In and Terms of Service

**StartTunnel**: MIT licensed. No terms of service. No content restrictions. No account that can be terminated. Use it however you want.

**Cloudflare Tunnel**: Cloudflare's ToS [prohibit streaming video or large file serving](https://www.cloudflare.com/service-specific-terms-zero-trust-services/) unless you use Cloudflare R2/Stream. Cloudflare reserves the right to terminate accounts "at any time, with or without notice for any reason or no reason at all." Your services are one policy change away from going dark.

**Tailscale**: More permissive terms than Cloudflare, but you still depend on a company's continued goodwill and operation. The free tier (3 users, 100 devices) has limits that paid tiers expand.

### What You Give Up

StartTunnel prioritizes sovereignty over convenience. That means:

- **No DDoS protection** — Your VPS IP is exposed on forwarded ports. Use your VPS provider's DDoS protection, or place a CDN in front if needed.
- **No global edge network** — Traffic routes through one VPS, not a global CDN. Latency depends on VPS location.
- **No built-in DNS** — You manage your own DNS records.
- **No identity provider integration** — Authentication is key-based and password-based, not SSO.
- **You manage the VPS** — Minimal maintenance (Debian + one binary), but it's yours to keep updated.

For many self-hosters, these trade-offs are not just acceptable — they're the point.

## Security

StartTunnel is built on [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), a modern VPN protocol with a minimal, auditable codebase (~4,000 lines of code in-kernel).

- **Encryption**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 for symmetric encryption, Curve25519 for key exchange, BLAKE2s for hashing
- **Pre-shared keys**: Each peer connection uses an additional pre-shared key (PSK) for a layer of post-quantum resistance
- **Key isolation**: Private keys are generated on-device and never leave the device. Only public keys are exchanged.
- **TLS passthrough**: Port-forwarded traffic is not decrypted by the VPS. If your service uses HTTPS, TLS terminates at the service, not the tunnel.

## Requirements

- Debian 12+ (Bookworm or newer)
- x86_64, aarch64, or riscv64
- Root access
- Public IP (required for clearnet port forwarding; not required for private VPN use)
