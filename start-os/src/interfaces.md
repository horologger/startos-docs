# Interfaces

A service interface is a network endpoint exposed by a service running on your server. Every installed service exposes one or more interfaces, each serving a different purpose. The service interfaces for a given service are listed on its dashboard under the **Service Interfaces** heading.

## Interface Types

- **UI** — A web-based user interface for interacting with the service in a browser. Examples: Vaultwarden web vault, Nextcloud dashboard, StartOS admin UI.

- **API** — A programmatic endpoint for apps and tools to communicate with the service. Examples: Bitcoin RPC, LND gRPC, Nextcloud WebDAV.

- **P2P** — A peer-to-peer endpoint for the service to communicate with other nodes on its network. Examples: Bitcoin P2P, Lightning P2P.

## Addresses

Clicking a service interface from the dashboard opens its **addresses page**. This page shows all the ways that interface can be reached, organized by [gateway](gateways.md).

### Gateway Tables

Each inbound gateway on your server has its own table. The rows in each table are the addresses available through that gateway. Addresses can be individually enabled or disabled.

Each table has the following columns:

| Column                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Toggle**                | Enable or disable the address. This directly affects iptables and firewall rules — disabling an address blocks traffic to it. Public IPv4 addresses are off by default. All other addresses are on by default.                                                                                                                 |
| **Access**                | **Public** or **Private**. Public addresses are reachable from the Internet. Private addresses are only reachable on the LAN or via VPN.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Type**                  | The address type: `IPv4`, `IPv6`, `Domain`, or `mDNS` (mDNS is only available on router gateways).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Certificate Authority** | Who signs the SSL certificate for this address: **Root CA** (your server's own CA), **Let's Encrypt** (publicly trusted), or **None** (non-SSL, e.g. plain HTTP).                                                                                                                                                              |
| **URL**                   | The fully composed URL for reaching the interface at this address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Actions**               | Context-dependent buttons: **Settings** (view required DNS records, DNS configuration, and/or port forwarding rules, with the ability to test each), **Delete** (remove domains that were manually added), **Open** (open the URL in a new tab), **Copy** (copy the URL to clipboard), **QR** (display a QR code for the URL). |

> [!NOTE]
> The Settings button appears for addresses that require external configuration: [public domains](clearnet.md) (DNS + port forwarding), [private domains](private-domains.md) (DNS), and [public IP addresses](public-ip.md) (port forwarding).

### Adding Domains

You can add domains to a gateway table by clicking "Add Domain" on the gateway and choosing either:

- **[Public Domain](clearnet.md)** — A clearnet domain (e.g. `mysite.com`) accessible from the Internet. Requires DNS configuration and port forwarding.
- **[Private Domain](private-domains.md)** — A custom domain (e.g. `nextcloud.private`) that works on LAN and VPN. Requires your gateway to use StartOS for DNS. Only available on Ethernet and Wireless gateways — not WireGuard (StartTunnel) gateways.

### Tor

If the [Tor](tor.md) service is installed and running, a **Tor** table also appears on the addresses page. Tor functions like a gateway but is managed as a marketplace service rather than a system gateway.

The Tor table is empty by default. To add onion addresses:

1. Open the Tor service and go to **Actions > Manage Onion Services**.

1. Select the service interface you want to create an onion address for.

1. Each onion address produces both an `HTTP` and `HTTPS` URL. The `HTTP` address is perfectly safe to use because Tor is a secure protocol. The `HTTPS` address uses a certificate signed by your server's Root CA.

1. Optionally, you can upload a private key to use a [vanity `.onion` address](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/vanity-addresses/).

1. To view your onion addresses, go to **Actions > View Onion Addresses**. They will also appear in the Tor table on each service interface's addresses page.

### Holesail

If the [Holesail](holesail.md) service is installed and running, a **Holesail** table also appears on the addresses page. Like Tor, Holesail is managed as a marketplace service.

The Holesail table is empty by default. To add tunnels:

1. Open the Holesail service and go to **Actions > Manage Tunnels**.

1. Select the service interface you want to create a tunnel for. Each tunnel produces a unique connection key.

1. To view your tunnel connection keys, go to **Actions > View Tunnels**. They will also appear in the Holesail table on each service interface's addresses page.
