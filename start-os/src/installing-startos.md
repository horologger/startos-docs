# Installing StartOS

This guide is for flashing StartOS to a USB drive, then installing it onto a desktop, laptop, or mini PC. For an up-to-date list of known-good hardware, please check out this [forum post](https://community.start9.com/t/known-good-hardware-master-list-hardware-capable-of-running-startos/).

## Download

1.  Visit the [Github release page](https://github.com/Start9Labs/start-os/releases/latest) to find the latest version of StartOS.

1.  Under "ISO Downloads", select the ISO for your architecture. StartOS is available in x86_64 (AMD64), aarch64 (ARM64), and RISC-V (RVA23). For x86_64 and aarch64, two variants are available:

    - **Standard**: Includes proprietary firmware and drivers for broader hardware compatibility, including display and wireless. Recommended for most users.

    - **Slim (FOSS-only)**: 100% open source, containing **no** proprietary firmware or drivers. Only compatible with certain hardware, such as the Start9 Server Pure.

1.  Verify the SHA256 checksum against the one listed on GitHub (optional but recommended).
    - **Mac**. Open a terminal and run:

          openssl dgst -sha256 <filename>.iso

    - **Linux**. Open a terminal and run:

          sha256sum <filename>.iso

    - **Windows**. Open PowerShell and run:

          Get-FileHash <filename>.iso

## Flash

1. Download and install [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) onto your Linux, Mac, or Windows computer.

1. Insert your USB drive into your computer.

1. Open balenaEtcher.

1. Click "Select Image" and select the `.iso` image you just downloaded.

1. Click "Select Target" and select your microSD card.

   > [!WARNING]
   > BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN you have selected the correct target USB flash drive. Whatever target you select will be **COMPLETELY ERASED**!!

1. Click "Flash!". You may be asked to approve the unusually large disk target and/or enter your password. Both are normal.

## Install

1. Remove the newly-flashed USB drive from your computer and plug it into your server. Choose the fastest available USB 3.0+ port - typically this is blue or labeled "SS" (SuperSpeed).

1. Power on your server, booting from USB.

   > [!TIP]
   > Occasionally, you may need to make some changes in your BIOS, such as turning off Secure Boot, or allowing USB boot for install. See the [Community Hub](https://community.start9.com) for guides or to get help.

1. The StartOS install wizard will now be available at `http://start.local`. You can also use a monitor, keyboard, and mouse. This is known as "Kiosk Mode".

1. Choose "Re-Install" to preserve existing StartOS data, or "Factory Reset" to start fresh. After install is complete, you will be prompted to remove the USB drive and refresh the page.
