# Creating Backups

Back up your server's data to a physical drive or a network folder. Backups can be encrypted and scheduled to run automatically.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Creating backups is an essential responsibility of self-hosting. If you do not make backups, you _will_ eventually lose your data.

## What You Need to Know

1. You can create backups to a [physical drive](#physical-drive) plugged directly into your server, or over-the-air to another device on the same LAN (a [network folder](#network-folder)).

1. Backups are encrypted using your master password. If you change your password prior backups retain the original password.

1. Services may choose to exclude certain files or folders from the backup. For example, Bitcoin excludes the blockchain, since it can be recovered by re-syncing.

1. Backups can take minutes or hours to complete, depending on your hardware and quantity of data.

1. A service cannot be used while it is backing up. You may, however, continue to use your server and other services.

1. Upon completion, StartOS issues a backup report, indicating which services were backed up, as well as any errors.

1. Backups taken from a specific system architecture (x86, ARM, RISC-V) are backed up for just that architecture. If restored to another architecture, they will likely need to be reinstalled to run efficiently.

## Best Practices

Even with proper backups the risk of data corruption is always non-zero. Therefore it is recommended to take additional care when backing up highly valuable or irreplaceable data like a lightning node:

- High quality SSDs should be favored over HDDs as a backup target.
- Backup to multiple targets.
- If backing up to multiple targets make sure all backups are up to date.

## Physical Drive

`EXT4` is the recommended format of your backup drive. `fat32` and `exFAT` are _not_ recommended and may not work.

> [!WARNING]
> Backing up to USB thumb drives or SD card media is not recommended unless you are using high-endurance, high-quality storage. Low-quality flash memory is prone to corruption and failure over time.
>
> If you are using a Raspberry Pi, backup drive _must_ be self-powered, or be connected via a powered USB hub, to prevent possible data corruption.

## Network Folder

A network folder backup sends your encrypted backup over the LAN to a shared folder on another device. First, create a shared folder on the target device, then connect to it from StartOS.

### Step 1. Create a Shared Folder

{{#tabs global="platform"}}

{{#tab name="Mac"}}

1. Identify or create a folder to store your server backups.

   > [!TIP]
   > This folder can be located on an external drive connected to your Mac.

1. Go to `System Settings > General > Sharing` and click the "info" icon.

1. Click the toggle to enable file sharing, then click the "plus" icon and select your backups folder.

1. Click "Options".

1. Select the user who owns the folder.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the hostname at the top of the sharing window. The hostname will be an address beginning with `smb://`. To use as hostname, disregard the `smb://` and simply enter the IP address that follows it. Alternatively, you can use the computer hostname (open Terminal and type `hostname`). Either method will work.

{{#endtab}}

{{#tab name="Windows"}}

1. Identify or create a folder to store your server backups.

   > [!TIP]
   > This folder can be located on an external drive connected to your Windows machine.

1. Right click the folder and click "Properties".

1. Click "Sharing".

1. Click "Share".

1. Select a user you want to use for login and click "Share".

   > [!WARNING]
   > If you get a dialog about your network being "Public", you may wish to change to "Private" if this is your home network. Otherwise you may turn on network sharing for public networks.

1. Note the Windows directory path in grey text, beginning at the first single slash (`\`). You will need this path when connecting from StartOS.

{{#endtab}}

{{#tab name="Ubuntu"}}

1.  Install Samba if not already:

    sudo apt install samba && sudo systemctl enable smbd

1.  Add your user to samba, replacing `$USER` with your Linux username.

        sudo smbpasswd -a $USER

    You will be prompted for your linux password. Then, you must create a new SMB password for the user with permission to write to your new backup share. Keep the password somewhere safe, such as Vaultwarden.

1.  Identify or create a folder to store your server backups.

    > [!TIP]
    > This folder can be located on an external drive connected to your Linux machine.

1.  Right click the folder and click "Properties".

1.  Click "Local Network Share".

1.  Select "Share this folder" and give the folder a Share name. _Remember the name_, you will need it later. Then click "Create Share".

1.  If your installation of Ubuntu is running a firewall by default or due to your own custom configuration, enter this command to allow connections to Samba. If it generates an error, you can safely ignore it:

    sudo ufw allow Samba

{{#endtab}}

{{#tab name="Mint"}}

1.  Install Samba if not already:

    sudo apt install samba && sudo systemctl enable smbd

1.  Add your user to samba, replacing `$USER` with your Linux username.

        sudo usermod -a -G sambashare $USER
        sudo smbpasswd -a $USER

    You will be prompted for your linux password. Then, you must create a new SMB password for the user with permission to write to your new backup share. Keep the password somewhere safe, such as Vaultwarden.

1.  Identify or create a folder to store your server backups.

    > [!TIP]
    > This folder can be located on an external drive connected to your Linux machine.

1.  Right click the folder and click "Sharing Options".

1.  Select "Share this folder" and give the folder a Share name (maximum 12 characters). _Remember the name_, you will need it later. Click "Create Share".

1.  If your installation of Mint is running a firewall by default or due to your own custom configuration, enter this command to allow connections to Samba. If it generates an error, you can safely ignore it:

    sudo ufw allow Samba

{{#endtab}}

{{#tab name="Other Linux"}}

1.  Install Samba if it is not already installed.
    - Arch:

      ```
      sudo pacman -S samba
      ```

    - Debian and Debian-based:

      ```
      sudo apt install samba
      ```

    - CentOS/Redhat

      ```
      sudo yum install samba
      ```

    - Fedora
      ```
      sudo dnf install samba
      ```

1.  Identify or create a folder to store your server backups. Make a note of the directory path. For example:

    ```
    mkdir -p /home/$USER/start9-backup
    ```

    replacing `$USER` with your Linux username and "start9-backup" with whatever you want the folder to be named.

    > [!TIP]
    > This folder can be located on an external drive connected to your Linux machine.

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you are on Fedora 38+, you need to do an extra step to allow the Samba share in SELinux:
    >
    > ```
    > sudo semanage fcontext --add --type "samba_share_t" "/home/$USER/start9-backup(/.*)?"
    > sudo restorecon -R /home/$USER/start9-backup
    > ```

1.  Configure Samba by adding the following to the end of your `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file:

        [backup-share]
            path = "/home/$USER/start9-backup"
            create mask = 0600
            directory mask = 0700
            read only = no
            guest ok = no

    Where:
    - `[backup-share]` can be replaced with whatever you want (must remain inside brackets). This is your `Share Name`. _Remember the name_, you will need it later.
    - `path` is the directory path to the share folder from above.

1.  Open a terminal and enter the following command, replacing `$USER` with your Linux username:

        sudo smbpasswd -a $USER

    This creates a password for the Local Network Share. Keep it somewhere safe, such as Vaultwarden.

1.  If your Linux system has a firewall enabled by default or due to custom configuration, you may need to allow connections to Samba. The command varies depending on the firewall in use:
    - For systems using UFW (commonly found on Debian-based distros):

          sudo ufw allow Samba

    - For systems using firewalld (common on RHEL-based distros):

          sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
          sudo firewall-cmd --reload

{{#endtab}}

{{#tab name="Synology"}}

1. In the Synology UI, go to `Control Panel > Shared Folder` and choose the folder you want to use as the destination for the backup.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Do not select an encrypted folder. Encrypted folders on Synology enforce a character limit of 143 characters. StartOS backups use folder/file names that are longer than 143 characters. The backup process will fail if you try to backup to an encrypted folder.

1. Go to `Control Panel > File Services > SMB` and click the SMB tab if it isn't already selected. Ensure that "Enable SMB service" is checked.

1. Under Advanced Settings on the same tab, set "Min SMB protocol" to `SMB2` and "Max SMB protocol" to `SMB3`.

1. Take note of your device name. Just under "Note" in a pale blue box, you will see "PC (Windows Explorer):" and "Mac (Finder):". These both provide network addresses that contain your device's name. This is the "Hostname" you will need when connecting from StartOS.

1. Still in File Services, click on the rsync tab. Click the checkbox to enable the rsync service.

1. Click "File Station" and locate the desired destination folder. Right click the folder, then _Properties > General_. Next to "Location" will be a folder location. The portion of the location _without the volume label_ is the value you will use for the "Path". For example, if the Location is `/volume1/Backups`, the value you care about is `Backups`.

{{#endtab}}

{{#tab name="TrueNAS"}}

1. Ensure you have already created a ZFS disk pool in `Storage > Pool` as a place to store your backups. If you need help with this step, see the [TrueNAS documentation](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaletutorials/storage/pools/createpoolscale/#creating-a-pool).

1. In the TrueNAS UI, create a user for writing backups. Go to `Accounts > Users > ADD`.

1. Enter a Full Name, Username, and Password for the new user. Near the bottom, click "Shell: nologin", and enable "Samba Authentication". Click "SUBMIT".

1. Go to `Services > SMB`. Enable SMB and check the box "Start Automatically".

1. Open a shell and create your backups directory. For example:

   mkdir /mnt/zpooldisk1/start9backupshare

1. Under `Sharing > Windows Shares (SMB)`, drill down into the path until you find the directory to be shared. Give the share a name and click "SUBMIT".

1. A `Configure ACL` dialog will emerge. Click "CONFIGURE NOW".

1. On the `Edit ACL` screen, under "User", click "Apply User" and select the username you created. On the right-hand side, `Permissions Type` should be set to "Basic" and `Permissions` should be set to "Full Control". Click **SAVE**.

### Step 2. Connect from StartOS

1. In StartOS, go to `System > Create Backup`.

1. Click "Open New".

1. Complete the form:
